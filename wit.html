        <p class="cnt-wit">
          Women in tech were basically working on making the space diverse and
          bringing more gender equality. Although the current scenario has a lot
          of improvements, the problem that we need to solve under women in tech
          is more of a gender problem. The first issue is many members don't have
          knowledge on what the stacks are and basic knowledge on how to get
          started hence it's very important to help them get a foundation on the
          programming and technical stacks and also to enable them to build
          projects. In order to make women comfortable in tech, we need to make
          them comfortable among themselves by providing them opportunities and
          mentors to help them to understand what next.

          <h3>Choose Your Stack</h3>
          <p class="p-event">
            Everybody has different interests and talents so rather than forcing
          them to learn any particular stack we have decided to provide learning
          opportunities according to their interest. For that by august 2021 we
          have asked our women members interest and their short and long term
          goals and we later have provided resources according to their interest
          and goals For better understanding of their learning journey we have
          given weekly assignments for submission.

          <h3>I am Remarkable</h3>
          <p class="p-event">
            #IamRemarkable is a Google initiative empowering women and other
            underrepresented groups to talk openly about their achievements in
            the workplace and beyond. Cultural and gender modesty norms can
            prevent anyone from acknowledging their remarkable attributes and
            expressing their achievements. #IamRemarkable aims at celebrating
            the spirit of every fighter, assuring them their achievements need
            to be heard. Tinkerhub CE Karunagappally and IEDC CEK are extremely
            delighted to host an #IamRemarkable workshop, facilitated by Ms.
            Ananya R, WIT Lead TinkerHub Foundation, Women TechMakers Ambassador
            of GDG Trivandrum and Associate Software Engineer at Accenture
